## 👋🏼 Hello there!
I'm **Ricardo Domínguez** (A.K.A. The cuban duck), **frontend developer since 2015** and **based in Madrid**.

Within the different branches of programming I’ve found in frontend development a perfect
match between my interest in refined visuals and my passion for software architecture.

I consider myself to be a decisive and pragmatic person, always trying to learn new things in
order to grow both personally and professionally.

I'm a big **Typescript and React fan** 🤓, but I've also worked with **Vue.js** and migrated some projects from **Angular 1.x**

### 🌱 I’m currently learning
- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- Improving my [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) knowledge
- [Styled components](https://styled-components.com/) (I've worked extensively with Emotion and I want to try this out)
- [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/)
- [vanilla-extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/)

### ⚡ My current frontend stack
- React
- Typescript
- [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) for CSS
