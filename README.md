## 👋🏼 Hello there!

I'm **Ricardo Domínguez** (A.K.A. The cuban duck), **frontend developer since 2015** and **based in Madrid**.

Within the different branches of programming I’ve found in frontend development a perfect
match between my interest in refined visuals and my passion for software architecture.

I consider myself to be a decisive and pragmatic person, always trying to learn new things in
order to grow both personally and professionally.

I'm a big **Typescript and React fan** 🤓, but I've also worked with **Vue.js** and migrated some projects from **Angular 1.x**

### 🌱 I’m currently learning

- Improving my [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) knowledge
- Starting with [Remix.run](https://remix.run/).
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), databases and a bit of backend to become T-shaped
