## 👋🏼 Hello there!
I'm **Ricardo Domínguez** (A.K.A. The cuban duck), frontend developer **based in Madrid**.

Within the different branches of programming I’ve found in frontend development a perfect
match between my interest in refined visuals and my passion for software architecture.

I consider myself to be a decisive and pragmatic person, always trying to learn new things in
order to grow both personally and professionally.

I'm a big **Typescript and React fan** 🤓, but I've also worked with **Vue.js** and migrated some projects from **Angular 1.x**

### 🌱 I’m currently learning
- [Remix](https://remix.run/)
- Improving my [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) knowledge
- [Styled components](https://styled-components.com/) (I've worked extensively with Emotion and I want to try this out)

### ⚡ My ideal web stack (right now!)
- React
- Typescript
- [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) for CSS
- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) for primitives
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for building
- [React-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) for data fetching
- [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for global states
- Jest & React testing library for unit / integration testing (TDD)
- Playwright for E2E
