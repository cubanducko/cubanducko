## 👋🏼 Hello there!

I'm **Ricardo Domínguez**, **a frontend developer since 2015**, currently based in **Madrid**.

Within the different branches of programming, I’ve found in frontend development the perfect balance between my interest in refined visuals and my passion for solid software architecture. Over the years, I’ve grown into a T-shaped developer: my deep expertise lies in building rich, maintainable, and scalable user interfaces, while I also bring a broad understanding across the stack.

Although my core strength is frontend, lately I’ve been diving into infrastructure and backend development, learning how systems behave behind the curtain and how to deliver more cohesive, end-to-end solutions.

I consider myself a decisive and pragmatic person, always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow both personally and professionally.

I’m a big **TypeScript** and **React** fan 🤓, but I’ve also worked with **Vue.js**, and I’ve led migrations from **Angular 1.x**.
I enjoy writing clean, predictable code, improving developer experience, and contributing to architectures that scale gracefully.
